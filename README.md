# SmallGimli

The code can be used as follows:

1. Check the preimage attack on 5-round Gimli-Hash and 9-round Gimli-XOF-128 where the word size is reduced from 32 bits to 8 bits.

2. Check the full-round distinguisher where the word size is reduced from 32 bits to 16 bits.

3. Check the 18-round distinguisher for the real Gimli permutation.
